Pomodoro Timer Widget
This project is a Pomodoro Timer Widget, which helps users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The widget cycles through periods of focused work (Pomodoro sessions) followed by short and long breaks, helping users stay productive and refreshed.

Features
Pomodoro Work Session: A focused work period set to a default duration (e.g., 25 minutes). After the time ends, the timer automatically switches to a short break.
Short Break: A brief break (e.g., 5 minutes) that allows you to rest between work sessions. After the break, it switches back to another Pomodoro work session.
Long Break: After completing several Pomodoro sessions, the timer automatically switches to a longer break (e.g., 15 minutes) for extended relaxation.
Automatic Session Shifting: The timer automatically transitions between Pomodoro work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks. After each session, it moves to the appropriate next session:
Work Session → Short Break
Short Break → Work Session
After multiple Work Sessions → Long Break
Long Break → Work Session
Infinite Loop: The sequence of Pomodoro sessions, short breaks, and long breaks will repeat infinitely, allowing continuous time management.
Progress Tracking: Each task displays a progress bar, showing how much of the Pomodoro session is complete.

How It Works
Start a Pomodoro Session: When you start the app, it will begin with a Pomodoro work session (default: 25 minutes).
Switch to Short Break: After completing the Pomodoro session, the timer will automatically switch to a short break (default: 5 minutes).
Return to Pomodoro Session: After the short break, another Pomodoro work session will start.
Long Break: After several Pomodoro sessions, the app will switch to a long break (default: 15 minutes).
Repeat: The sequence will continue in an infinite loop, switching between work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks automatically.
Customization
You can adjust the duration of the Pomodoro sessions, short breaks, and long breaks by modifying the config.js file in the project. The configuration allows you to change the timings as per your preference.
